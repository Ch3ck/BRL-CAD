BRL-CAD work
=============

BRL-CAD was created by [Nyah Check](https://github.com/Ch3ck), and it's a summary of his work at the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.summerocode.withgoogle.com) in 2013 with [BRL-CAD](www.brlcad.org) on Implementing the [PULL](http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2013#Pull_Routine_for_reversing_the_effects_of_push_on_Geometry) routine, downloaded from [Google Melange]() since Google is migrating to a new GSoC site.
